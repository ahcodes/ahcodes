### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my project portfolio to showcase my coding skills to potential employers.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also learning a plethora of related and unrelated tech skills like SQL, Python, React and a few others.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on real-world problems and hope to make a lasting impact in the STEM industry.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m also on the lookout for good FOSS projects to contribute to, so if you run across something interesting, let me know!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to my coding skills.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Element (Riot.im): ah_11
